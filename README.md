# code-snippets-blog
Code snippets that I used in blog posts at https://www.katzentante.at or (rarely) in posts for other blogs. Most code snippets are written in `R` and some are written in `Python` or `MATLAB`. The folder names contain the year and month when the blog post was published and a few words to describe the content. This README contains all folders with and a link to the corresponding blog post.

## R

Please be aware that some of the blog posts and code snippets in `R` are already 3 years old and I've learned a lot since then :)

MATLAB, how I hate it ... I had to use it for some time and sometimes I wrote a piece of code that I thought might be useful again. So I collected those pieces and some will be published on my blog.
